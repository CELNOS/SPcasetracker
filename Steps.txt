1. have the user initiate by entering (eventually pressing button) "new_case"
    right now just asking if they want to add a case
2. ask for inputs
    case#
    year
    organ(s), separated by ","
    is_normal
    my main diagnosis
    my additional diagnoses
        these can be added later
    final diagnosis
    additional final diagnose
3. place inputs into excel file on google docs
    title: "SP_Case_Tracker"
    tab: "AllData" (aka sheet1)
    structure:
        class SP_Case("case#", "year", ["organs"], "my_main_diagnosis",
        ["my_additional_diagnoses"], "final_main_diagnosis", ["final_additional_diagnoses"])
4. continually print/display total number of cases in file
